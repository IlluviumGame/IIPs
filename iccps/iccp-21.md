## Simple Summary
This proposal introduces updated pricing, pegged to USD, for Illuvium Beyond Wave 3 and future waves, alongside a revised rewards points system for individual stretch goals. A 1.5x multiplier is applied to Alpha D1SKS to ensure fairness and alignment with their premium status. Players must open D1SKS to earn points, creating a more engaging and rewarding experience for collectors.



## Abstract
Building on community feedback and insights from previous waves, this proposal updates D1SK pricing to align with accessibility and value while pegging prices to USD for stability. The individual stretch goal rewards system is also revised to award points based on D1SK openings. The system includes a 1.5x multiplier for Alpha D1SKS, ensuring that premium purchases are incentivised appropriately.



## Overview
This proposal introduces the following key changes:

#### USD-Pegged Pricing
To ensure pricing stability and accessibility, D1SK prices will be pegged to USD and dynamically converted to ETH at the time of purchase. The updated pricing for Wave 3 is:

- Standard D1SK: $4.99
- Mega D1SK: $29.99
- Alpha Standard D1SK: $9.99
- Alpha Mega D1SK: $89.99

#### Enhanced Rewards Points System
Individual stretch goals will now be based on points earned by opening D1SKS, not just purchasing them. A 1.5x multiplier is applied to Alpha D1SKS to reflect their premium value:

- Standard D1SK: 1 point
- Mega D1SK: 6 points
- Alpha Standard D1SK: 2 points (base) → 3 points (with multiplier)
- Alpha Mega D1SK: 18 points (base) → 27 points (with multiplier)

The points system ensures fairness and rewards players proportionally for their investment.



### Sale Mechanics Adjustments

#### USD Peg for Pricing

All D1SK prices are fixed to USD values as outlined above.
Real-time ETH conversions will be performed at the time of purchase using a trusted price oracle.

#### Enhanced Rewards Points System

Players must open D1SKS to earn points for individual stretch goals.
A 1.5x multiplier is applied to Alpha D1SKS to balance rewards with their premium pricing.
Rewards for individual stretch goals will scale based on cumulative points earned.

#### Applicability to Future Waves

These changes will apply to Wave 3 and all subsequent waves unless explicitly revised by another ICCP.



## Rationale
The updated pricing and enhanced rewards points system address key community feedback:

**Pricing Accessibility:** The adjusted pricing makes Illuvium Beyond more approachable for new players while retaining value for collectors.
**Pricing Stability:** Pegging prices to USD removes the unpredictability caused by ETH price fluctuations.
**Fairer Rewards:** The 1.5x multiplier for Alpha D1SKS ensures they are proportionally rewarded, maintaining fairness across all product types.
**Engagement:** Requiring D1SK openings for points increases player interaction and adds an exciting layer of progression to Beyond.
