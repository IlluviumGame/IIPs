## Simple Summary
Reduces council members payments from 30 ILV per epoch to a fixed value of $5000 USDT, per member, per 3 month epoch, payable in ILV.
 
## Abstract
The intention is to lower per epoch payments to a more reasonable value for the workload required from a council member. 
 
## Rationale
The current payment of 30 ILV is somewhat excessive for each council member's required involvement, so this ICCP is to ensure council member payments stay pegged to a fixed dollar amount, regardless of future market moves.
