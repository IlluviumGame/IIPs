## Simple Summary
The proposal aims to enhance the uniqueness of Wave 1 Alpha Illuvitars in Illuvium Beyond by introducing exclusive visual Alpha stamps (“Premium Alpha Stamps”), which will differ from the “Alpha Stamps” used in subsequent waves.


## Abstract
In order to accentuate the exclusivity of Wave 1 Alpha Illuvitars, the implemented “Golden” Alpha Stamps will only be assigned to them (now referred to as “Premium Alpha Stamp”).

The subsequent Waves (2, 3, 4, and 5) within Set 1 will feature a visibly different colored stamp from Wave 1. This will be referred to as the “Alpha Stamp” and will be the same color across the remaining Waves.


## Overview
The main purpose of implementing the “Alpha Stamp” on Illuvitars (ICCP-8) was to visually differentiate Alpha Illuvitars from non-alpha versions, enhancing their exclusivity and collectability for those seeking to showcase their rare collectibles in Illuvium Beyond.

By introducing the "Premium Alpha Stamp" solely to Wave 1, it reinforces the original marketing strategy that positioned Wave 1 Alpha Illuvitars as highly desirable premium items with limited availability, catering to the interests of collectors and investors. This “Premium Alpha Stamp” will visually differentiate Alpha Illuvitars from Wave 1 and those from future waves.


## Rationale
To acknowledge the premium nature and pricing of Wave 1 Alpha Illuvitars, the unique and exclusive "Premium Alpha Stamps" will be created, clearly distinguishing them from the rest of Set 1 Alphas.   

The remaining Alpha Illuvitars in Set 1 will still feature a visually distinct "Alpha Stamp" of a different color, ensuring the exclusiveness of all Alpha Illuvitars while specifically highlighting the unique difference for Wave 1.


## Summary
By introducing an exclusive "Premium Alpha Stamp" for Wave 1 Alpha Illuvitars, this will emphasize their premium aspect and uniqueness.

Alpha Illuvitars in subsequent Waves will still maintain exclusivity compared to non-alpha Illuvitars by having a visually distinct "Alpha Stamp" (which will be the same color across Waves 2, 3, 4 & 5).
