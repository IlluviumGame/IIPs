## Simple Summary
This proposal aims to enable a weighted voting system for Epoch 8 and future epochs. This assists in further diversifying the voting power of individuals so they can vote for several qualified candidates rather than one.

## Abstract
The request for a way to vote for multiple nominees has been an ongoing discussion since the prior epoch. As snapshot evolves and has enabled a split voting system that utilises quadratic voting it is now possible to enable this feature without removing other existing features. This would enable voters to split their available vILV amongst as many candidates as they’d like.

## Rationale
It should be clear that these features are additive to the existing system. Voting will still be blind and no one will be able to see the outcome until after voting has concluded. Also if voters wish to vote for a single candidate it is still possible.

Most democratic government bodies have voting systems that enable voters to vote for multiple candidates so that voters can better select candidates that represent their preferences. In the case of Illuvium that feels important considering there may be 2+ candidates that are relevant to your personal voting criteria. If many voters felt that they both fit well however one fit more than others then general sentiment wouldn’t match the overall outcome.
A core premise of this system update would be as a quality of life improvement. Not only would it enable more options for voters but act as a simple deterrent to anyone that wanted to split their wallets in an effort to vote for multiple candidates. This proposal both enables this as a feature for those users while maintaining the integrity of quadratic voting.

If you would like to try this new voting system for yourself you can here: https://snapshot.org/#/pistachiodao.eth/proposal/0x21f64875abbca71762a980efae43ab62b546d54f19a208d0e61a5d7cee571a35
For example if we had Jerry, Beth and Summer all running for council. Let’s say Jerry and Beth were very pro community and Summer was against it. However, Beth was still a much better candidate than Jerry. Then with single choice voting even if 80% of the community collectively preferred the beliefs of both Jerry and Beth they may not be elected. With this updated system if the voter had 10 vILV he would be able to put 8 vILV towards Beth and 2 vILV towards Jerry. This better accommodates their preference as they think both candidates are appropriate.

There was very clear positive sentiment surrounding the weighted voting proposal. Many advocated that they had already wanted to vote for 2-3 candidates and this would be a welcome change.
There was also discussion surrounding the potential risks of larger voters being able to game the system. After deliberation it was determined that this should not be an issue based on past epochs.
