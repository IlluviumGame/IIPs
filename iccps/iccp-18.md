## Summary
This ICCP intends to recalibrate the minimum ETH threshold required to trigger revenue distribution from the current 500 ETH to 150 ETH. The primary aim of this change is to increase the frequency of buybacks and reduce the likelihood of frontrunning, thereby enhancing the efficiency and fairness of the revenue distribution process. 

## Implementation
**IIP-22 Revenue Distribution:**

R(min): The minimum daily revenue distribution.

X	X	X

R(min): 500 ETH

**Changed to:**

R(min): The minimum ~~daily~~ revenue distribution.

X	X	X


R(min): ~~500~~ 150 ETH

## Rationale
By modifying the current revenue distribution mechanism by lowering the minimum ETH threshold to 150 ETH. This adjustment is designed to achieve several key benefits: (1) it will increase the frequency of buybacks, which can help support the token's price and provide a more consistent return to investors; (2) minimize the risk of frontrunning, where traders exploit advanced knowledge of upcoming transactions to gain an unfair advantage; (3) improve overall market stability by creating more predictable and regular buyback events; and (4) enhance investor confidence, reassuring stakeholders of our dedication to maintaining a healthy and robust market environment.

## Test Cases
None
