## Simple Summary:
This proposal suggests a retroactive modification to the airdrop point value of the Wave 40, Wave 30, and Wave 20 Survival Tasks.

## Overview:
This proposal stipulates that the points assigned to the Wave 40, Wave 30, and Wave 20 completion tasks will be adjusted to values that align more closely with similar free-to-play milestones. The exact values are to be determined by Illuvium Labs.

## Rationale:
The Wave 40 survival task is currently worth 1 million airdrop points, Wave 30 is worth 100 thousand, and Wave 20 is worth 10 thousand. These point values drastically exceed the effort required to complete it compared to the point values assigned to other free-to-play tasks. The goal of the airdrop campaign is to reward legitimate player gameplay, not to disproportionately reward specific game modes.

While other airdrop point reward structures may also have imperfections, the current structure for the Survival Waves stands out as particularly harmful to the DAO and the players. Therefore, it requires an immediate and retroactive adjustment. 

The DAO has responsibility to encourage active players, including those who are free-to-play and particularly those who are paying players. To meet this goal, the alignment of point values to reasonably encourage free-to-play players while not disincentivizing paying players will be better realized through this proposal.

## Additional Considerations:
IIP-58-R already accounts for exploits and bugs. Utilizing multiple accounts to repeatedly complete Wave 40 is considered an exploit. As such, this is not covered by this proposal, as it can be addressed directly by Labs. Legitimate players should be rewarded for the time they spend completing this task, while illegitimate players should not. Labs is best equipped to determine which accounts are exploiting and which are legitimate, based on their insight into player behavior and activity.

A dynamic version of survival, as a potential long-term solution to survival being easy to replicate by copying other players' gameplay due to the static nature of gameplay, is also not covered by this proposal. Labs is aware of this and is working towards preventative measures to ensure that the multi-account exploit cannot happen in the future at the same scale seen recently.

The remaining reward structures will be reviewed and improved in the next new sub-period, in line with IIP-58-R.
