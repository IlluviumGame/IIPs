## Simple Summary
By the specification of Governance V2 (IIP-32), an ICCP must be passed to begin the transition period to Governance V2. This ICCP specifies that the transition period will begin on April 13th.

## Overview
The requirement of an ICCP to start the transition period was established to provide time to identify whether viable alternatives to Snapshot elections would be possible. At the current time, Snapshot has been identified as the best option for the Governance V2 election process. It is currently undesirable to detract from web and blockchain development by requesting a custom solution from Labs, and Snapshot will meet all the criteria for an election under Governance V2.

The transition period lasts 45 days, and will begin on April 13th, concluding on May 28th. May 28th is the last day of the current epoch. This will allow for the maximum amount of time to prepare for this expanded election process. This additionally allows DAO members interested in running for a sub-council under Gov V2 to familiarize themselves with the nomination process and the structure of Gov V2 prior to the nomination period and elections.


## Transition Period
The 45 day transition period begins on April 13th, announcement that the election is upcoming + nomination information + governance education.

On day 5 (April 18th), nominations for Gov V2 sub-councils open.

On day 20 (May 3rd), nominations for Gov V2 sub-councils close.

On day 25 (May 8th), voting begins.

On day 30 (May 13th), voting concludes. Note: This is a 5 day voting period.

Between day 30 and day 40, sub-councils meet and elect representatives to serve on the IMC. Note: This 10 day period will also be used to help onboard new sub-council members.

On day 40 (May 23rd), IMC representatives are named.

On day 45 (May 28th), Gov V2 sub-councils and the IMC take leadership of the DAO.
