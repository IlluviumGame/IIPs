## Simple Summary
Members of the community have expressed a desire for Alpha Illuvitars to include a visual indication of the Illuvitar's Alpha status. This proposal would direct the Illuvium team to update the Illuvitars product to include an  Alpha stamp as a visual element.

## Overview
Alpha Illuvitars are meant to be the most exclusive Illuvitars due to their limited nature but are currently visually indistinguishable from the non-alpha Illuvitars. Adding the stamp to the Illuvitars adds value for those who are looking for exclusive collectibles in the Illuvium Universe. As a premium product it is important that users can display the exclusive and limited nature of their Alpha Illuvitars. 

## Implementation
A variety of potential visual indicators have been discussed, and the Illuvium team has come back with this stamp as the most favourable implementation. This stamp will be applied to all Alpha Illuvitars, including retroactively adding them to Wave 1.

Alpha stamps will appear on d1skplates.

## Summary
Adding an Alpha stamp onto the Illuvitar images is a value add for those who have and will purchase Alpha Disks and increases the overall collectability of Illuvitars.
