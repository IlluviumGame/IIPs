## Objective:
Include In-App purchases in calculations for rewards for the Alliance Program.

## Summary:
Currently only ETH revenue is calculated for Alliance Program rewards, but this excludes revenue from one of Illuviumâ€™s core games. Currently Illuvium Zero revenue comes solely from in-app purchases and there may be other future titles that also accept payments via in-app purchases.

## Overview:
Mobile app stores do take a percentage of the revenue, upwards of 30%. Illuvium Labs should decide on a % of in-app revenue to be used towards the Alliance Program based on costs associated with these types of transactions.

Mobile purchases are made with local currency. At the end of each Alliance Program pay period these local currencies will be converted to ETH. This ETH will be added to direct ETH sales to determine Alliance Program Tier status and rewards.

## Rationale:
Creators should be incentivized to make content and promote all areas/games of the Illuvium ecosystem and currently there is no incentive for Illuvium ZERO. This will be increasingly more important if there would be a push for free to play gamers to play ZERO or if other titles were ported to mobile making use of in-app purchases.
