### Simple summary
This proposal aims to distribute the halted leaderboard rewards to the previous occupants of the top rankings prior to wave three commencing. Pausing the leaderboard rewards was done to ensure fair leaderboard rewards, but with the release of wave three, the leaderboard rankings may instead be unfairly affected. Wave three introduces new investors, new collections and may increase difficulty of obtaining the previously promised leaderboard rewards. 

### Overview
To correct the pause of leaderboard rewards, this proposal pushes for a number of steps to be taken.

1. The secondary wallet feature needs to go live.
2. The previous leaderboard holders should be granted time to sleeve their illuvitars.
3. A snapshot must be taken before wave 3 commences.
4. The missed rewards must be paid out to the players of the particular leaderboard rankings.
5. Wave 3 starts normally after the previous steps are taken

These steps provide the missed rewards to the previous leaderboard rankers who would otherwise have to unfairly compete over them with new investors from wave 3.

### Rationale
The investors that bought Illuvitars with the promise of getting leaderboard rewards now see those same rewards be halted until wave three starts. There was no communication as to the purpose of this pause except for a push towards migrating the assets. Migrating, however, would put your assets at risk so a longer pause was required until the wallet integration was supported. To ensure fair leaderboard rewards, this proposal aims to distribute the missed leaderboard rewards to the players that were previously in the top 100.
