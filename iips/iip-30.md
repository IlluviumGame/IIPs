## Simple Summary:

The Council is launching a new pricing strategy for its collection and album features, with reduced prices for standard and mega D1sks. Three new features, Alpha D1sks and Misprints and Launch Party Goals, will increase excitement and rarity. The Illuvium marketing team has requested D1sks for promotion to make Illuvitars a more sought-after product.

## Overview:

The Council has a new pricing strategy to make its collection and album features more accessible and exciting. Alpha D1sks, Misprints, and Launch Party Goals are being introduced to keep customers engaged.

The proposed pricing structure is as follows:

#### Standard D1sks: 0.005 ETH
#### Mega D1sks: 0.025 ETH

#### Alpha Standard D1sks: 0.025 ETH (limited to 100,000)
#### Alpha Mega D1sks: 0.125 ETH (limited to 20,000)

The contents of a Mega Disk will now include a guaranteed rare Illuvitar, instead of a guaranteed rare item. This means the guaranteed rare can no longer be an accessory.

Alpha disks are available for three days from the start of the sale or until sold out.

## Misprints: 

Any Illuvitars not revealed in the first 3 months from the sale date will be considered "Misprints" and exceptionally rare. These misprints will be auctioned off after Wave 1 of the sale.

## Launch Party Goals: 
The Illuvium Launch Party Goals have been created to keep customers engaged. The specific goals will be kept a mystery, but two examples are:

Community Goals: If 5,000 D1sks are sold, all customers who purchase a D1sk will receive an exclusive "Welcome to the Party" emote.

Individual Goals: If 10 D1sks are purchased, customers will receive a 10% off merch code.

Additionally, the Illuvium marketing team has requested 3,000 standard and 600 mega D1sks for promotional purposes, which the council has approved.

## Rationale:

The rationale behind the new pricing strategy from the council is to increase accessibility and excitement for community members. By introducing Alpha D1sks and Misprints, as well as Launch Party Goals, the council hopes to engage customers and keep them interested in their collection and album features. Using promotional disks is crucial for boosting engagement and maintaining the success of marketing efforts.
