## Simple Summary:
This proposal aims to commemorate the participation of Illuvium Zero land owners with an exclusive “Illuvium Zero Battle Board Reward”. This Battle board will be granted to all Landowners who meet the threshold of Lv 7 Nexus in the time period leading up to Open Public Beta. (After the conclusion of the Minting window for Alpha).

1 Battle board redemption ERC20 token will be dropped to each qualifying wallet at the end of the fuel production lead time. The distribution of these redemption tokens will be either automated or done manually with a snapshot, ensuring that land owners who have achieved the required building level receive them at an appropriate time after Public Open Beta. These tokens will be NFTs so tradeable and sellable.



## Rationale:
These Battle Boards will be a visualflex to commemorate and celebrate the players and investors who have purchased and played the very earliest full launch version of Illuvium Zero. 

Participation in fuel production in the early stage of kick starting the economy will be worth being early to.  This concept has the potential to invigorate activity within ILV-Z, as dormant land owners might return to obtain exclusive Battle board or new players might take the opportunity to become Landowners for the first time. 

The attainable threshold for triggering the “Zero Battle Board” airdrops requires Nexus Lv 7, which should align roughly with the time frame required to effectively ramp up fuel production during the Pre Launch Phase. Using this metric will not disadvantage Zero Owners who intend to set up their plots to hunt for Blueprints as opposed to just producing fuel.

This new proposal takes into account the feedback from a divided community around the Ranger and Drone skin economy. Whilst many voters felt that a reward was a good idea for Zero to bring the rewards more in line with Beyond players, the consensus appears to be that inflating the number of Ranger Skins and Drone Skins to allow for Regional skins was going to potentially undermine the future value of Skins.

**About the Exclusive Battle Board Skin:**

- The Art and Production Team should have the freedom to create what they feel will be practically and aesthetically desirable. The loose brief being that it is a Zero based or Map of Illuvium based design.

We will entrust the final design decisions to the Illuvium Labs’ Art Team, leveraging their expertise. This approach guarantees a streamlined scope and allows them to determine the optimal color palette and design for the Battle Boards. Their involvement will ensure the distinctiveness of these boards in contrast to the ongoing development and design of the other Illuvium Battle Boards.



## Conclusion:
By implementing exclusive “Zero Rewards Battle Board Skins”, the allocation across each participating land owner will remain relatively scarce with a maximum of 20,000, but realistically less. With limited quantities and a nod to the early Landowners (OGs), these Battleboards will carry a sense of desirability being exclusive only obtainable during the ILV-Z Pre Open Beta Fuel Ramp Up Stage. At it heart this proposal is just a way to thank the Land owners and give them something that is unique to Illuvium Zero.
