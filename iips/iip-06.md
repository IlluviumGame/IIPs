## Simple Summary
Since Illuvium is mainly targetting gamers, we need to use flash pools as a marketing tool to attract players from similar projects.

## Abstract 
Once SNX and XYZ flash pools has ended, create new ILV staking flash pool, that will allow Axie Infinity token holders to stake and yield farm ILV tokens.

## Overview
Since flash pool weight is reduced to 0.02 as per Kierans post in Discord, this proposal is aimed to create AXS flash pool with weight of 0.02 for the period agreed or set by the Illuvium governance.
 
## Rationale
AXS (Axie Infinity) project gained huge popularity among players around the world and represents perfect demographics that we can target and use to create hype around Illuvium.
