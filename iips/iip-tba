## Simple Summary
The Illuvinati Council is being presented with the option to add Yield Guild Games’ governance/utility token - YGG - as the fifth staking flash pool.

## Abstract
Create a new ILV staking flash pool for the YGG token.

### Rationale
As noted in IIP-11, flash pools have the ability to generate a number of new ILV token holders by onboarding individuals from strong communities.

Yield Guild Games - and the YGG token - is a potent candidate for this because:
- The YGG community consists entirely of those interested, or actively engaged in, gaming in the crypto space
- The YGG community is highly engaged, but the Illuvium segment of the community is relatively minor in size
- Due to token utility being significantly later in the road map - in addition to a dearth of other offerings - YGG holders have significant tokens but nowhere to put them
- Establishing stronger ties with large gaming guilds is in Illuvium’s interest, and Yield Guild Games is the largest
