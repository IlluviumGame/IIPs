## Overview:

Labs should work towards creating a system that gives players of Gauntlet and future games rewards based on owning assets including but not limited to Illuvials, without having those assets impact the gameplay unless they are tied to gameplay elements in that game or game mode outside of this system as well.

It should be at Labs discretion when to apply these systems and to which parts of any game.

## Rationale:
Many games and genres in the gaming industry are currently optimized and designed with cosmetic-only monetization, and applying concepts from these games to Illuvium titles seems beneficial. However, they are not suited to incorporate ownership in a way that would alter gameplay.
Gauntlet and potentially other future games are better suited for a Web 2.5 approach, where ownership could provide rewards and could tie into an economic aspect but does not directly impact gameplay.

This approach aligns with the industry standard of comparable games and genres, which typically avoid mechanics that differentiate player capabilities based on owned assets or, in the case of non-NFT-based gaming, rights to access or use virtual items as outlined in end-user license agreements (EULAs). In both cases, these rights or owned assets do not alter the capabilities of players.
