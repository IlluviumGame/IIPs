## Abstract:
This proposal recommends refunding unused fuel purchased below the newly established minimum rail. Due to delays in implementing a structured fuel pricing model, some players were able to accumulate fuel below sustainable levels. This refund ensures fairness while preventing an unnecessary economic hit. The funds in the IMX wallet were never distributed as revenue, so this correction would not require a clawback from past distributions. However, as this involves withholding revenue anticipated for distribution, governance must formally approve the proposal. The approximate total refund amount is 70 ETH.

## Simple Summary
The fuel system lacked a pricing floor, allowing some players to accumulate fuel below sustainable thresholds. This proposal suggests refunding purchases made below the new minimum rail to ensure fairness and maintain economic stability. This prevents excessive purchasing power advantages while maintaining fairness for engaged players. The refund will come from funds that were never distributed, making it a correction rather than a clawback. The total refund is approximately 70 ETH.

## Overview:
Fuel sales did not initially have a bottom rail, which resulted in players being able to buy fuel at unsustainable prices. The council discussed implementing a lower bound for months, and the team agreed, but development priorities and team size reductions delayed its implementation. This meant fuel accumulated below intended levels before the system was balanced correctly.

### Key points regarding fuel accumulation:
- 10 people hold 40% of the fuel.
- 250 people hold 70% of the fuel.
- Many who accumulated fuel acknowledged the risk in public discussions, understanding that the lack of a price floor was an unintended flaw.

The challenge is balancing the migration to the Unified Fuel economy while ensuring fairness for all players. The DAO is responsible for maintaining economic integrity for all participants, not just the few who leveraged the system's weaknesses. Refunds will target fuel purchased below 25% of the maximum rail, as that was the intended price floor.

Landholders who transferred fuel from their plots to the market below the 0.25 rail will also be eligible for a refund to ensure fairness across the board. This ensures landholders are not disadvantaged due to the system's incomplete state at the time.

## Rationale:
Implementing a bottom rail was essential for long-term sustainability, but delays allowed some players to take advantage of the old system. While it’s fair that players actively engaged with the game retain value, allowing excessive fuel accumulation to carry over would disrupt the economy.

### This refund ensures:
- Players who played the game still got value from their experience.
- Those who leveraged an unintended system flaw don’t retain an outsized purchasing power advantage.
- The overall economy remains balanced and sustainable.
- The DAO loses some revenue, but it’s correcting an issue rather than clawing back funds already distributed.
- Landholders are fairly compensated for any fuel they transfered below the intended minimum rail, maintaining trust and fairness in the system.

Additionally, this proposal aligns with the broader overhaul of Overworld’s economy, which will introduce new progression mechanics, acquisition rates, and balance adjustments. The goal is to ensure fairness across all in-game systems while maintaining trust in the DAO’s governance.
