## Simple Summary
This proposal seeks to establish a standardized allocation of 5000 Standard D1SKS and 1000 Mega D1SKS for marketing and promotional activities at the launch of each Illuvium: Beyond wave. By securing a set number of D1SKS for future waves, this initiative aims to bolster community engagement, attract new players, and enhance Illuvium's ecosystem visibility.

## Abstract
To expand Illuvium: Beyondâ€™s reach and create a robust framework for sustained marketing efforts, this proposal recommends that 5000 Standard and 1000 Mega D1SKS be allocated for each new wave. This allocation will serve as a consistent promotional reserve, allowing the DAO to execute targeted campaigns, sponsor events, and drive long-term growth. 

## Rationale
Allocating a set number of D1SKS for marketing across multiple waves will enable Illuvium to execute a consistent and impactful promotional strategy that supports both community engagement and growth objectives. By reserving D1SKS for ongoing marketing initiatives, the DAO can drive higher levels of player interaction, build brand loyalty, and attract a steady influx of new players. This approach not only incentivizes participation but also provides the flexibility needed to sustain active engagement over time. Utilizing D1SKS for onboarding promotions helps lower barriers to entry for new players, particularly those unfamiliar with Web3, by giving them tangible incentives to explore the Illuvium ecosystem. Furthermore, maintaining a reserved pool of D1SKS allows for strategic partnerships, influencer collaborations, and even event sponsorships, all of which enhance Illuvium's visibility within the gaming community.

## Conclusion:
The proposed allocation of 5000 Standard and 1000 Mega D1SKS per wave provides Illuvium with a marketing tool to grow its player base and foster long-term community engagement while inviting new members into the Illuvium community.
