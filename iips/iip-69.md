### Abstract
This proposal outlines key updates for the upcoming Illuvium Beyond Wave 3 sale and the continuation of the Illuvium Beyond Set 1 Leaderboard. We aim to address missed rewards for Set 1 Leaderboards, provide clarity on the ongoing leaderboard structure, and introduce exciting new competitive and community-driven elements for the Wave 3 sale. These changes are designed to enhance player engagement, ensure the sustainability of the ecosystem, and create long-term value for participants through refined gameplay and reward systems.

### Simple Summary
This proposal covers four key areas:
1. **Missed rewards** for the Set 1 Leaderboard will be addressed with a one-time payout covering nine weeks of missed rewards.
2. **The continuation of the Set 1 Leaderboard** will include an increase in the weekly rewards pool and expansion of the leaderboard ranks.
3. **The Wave 3 Leaderboard** will run during the Wave 3 sale, rewarding the top 250 participants from a shared ILV pool that grows with every ETH spent.
4. **The Wave 3 Alpha Sale** will feature limited-edition Alpha D1sks, which will contribute extra points to stretch goals but offer no functional advantage over standard D1sks.

### Overview
#### Missed Rewards for the Set 1 Leaderboards
Before the Set 1 Leaderboards officially go live again and ranking competition resumes, we will review a snapshot of the rankings during the last reward distribution. A one-time payment will be made to cover the missed rewards, compensating participants for a total of 9 weeks of leaderboard rewards.
#### Continuation of the Set 1 Leaderboard
To further strengthen and grow the leaderboard feature in Illuvium Beyond, we will increase the weekly rewards pool from 100 ILV to 250 ILV and expand the number of rewarded ranks to 200. Weekly rewards will be distributed, with the council periodically reviewing the rewards structure to ensure its ongoing relevance and balance.
However, if Illuvium Beyond experiences any technical issues or vulnerabilities that prevent the game from functioning as intended, the rewarding element of the leaderboard will be temporarily halted. This ensures that players are only rewarded when the game is fully operational and the leaderboard can actively be played.

#### Weekly Set 1 Leaderboard rewards.
| Rank    | Reward Per Receiver | Amount of Receivers | Total Rewards |
|---------|---------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1       | 30                  | 1                   | 30            |
| 2       | 21                  | 1                   | 21            |
| 3       | 15                  | 1                   | 15            |
| 4-5     | 10                  | 2                   | 20            |
| 6-10    | 6                   | 5                   | 30            |
| 11-20   | 3                   | 10                  | 30            |
| 21-40   | 1.5                 | 20                  | 30            |
| 41-65   | 1                   | 25                  | 25            |
| 66-100  | 0.6                 | 35                  | 21            |
| 101-140 | 0.4                 | 40                  | 16            |
| 141-200 | 0.2                 | 60                  | 12            |

Changes to the reward structure can be requested earlier by the council, design team, or community if the need arises.

### Illuvium Beyond Wave 3 Leaderboard

The Wave 3 Leaderboard will be active exclusively during the Illuvium Beyond Wave 3 Sale. Once the sale period ends, the leaderboard will close, and the winners will be announced.\
The top 250 participants will be rewarded from a shared pool. At the start of the Wave 3 Sale, this pool will contain 2,000 ILV. For every ETH (not sILV2) spent during the sale, the shared pool will increase by 10 ILV.\
At the end of the sale, the total pool will be distributed among the top 250 participants on the Wave 3 Leaderboard.

#### For example on closing day the shared pool = 5000 ILV
|    Rank | Reward Percentage | Amount of Receivers | Total Percentage | Total Rewards Per <br>Player Assuming<br>5000 ILV in pool |

**Additionally, to boost competition, we are introducing special prizes.**
-	Top 25 of the leaderboard will receive 1 Unique version of 1 of the Wave 3 Illuvitars.
-	The top 5 will receive a special HOLO version of one of the Wave 3 Illuvitars.
-	The Winner will receive a special 1 of a kind Wave 3 Illuvitar. <br>

The Wave 3 Leaderboard structure will be reviewed after the conclusion of the sale.

### Wave 3 Alpha Sale
As with the previous two Waves, Wave 3 will also feature an Alpha Sale. 
However, this sale will have a slightly different structure to emphasise that Alpha Illuvitars have no functional differences compared to regular Illuvitars â€” they are simply the first of their wave. To highlight their uniqueness, we are introducing a rarity factor for Alpha D1sks. <br>
There will be a limited release of 2500 Alpha Standard D1sks and 1000 Alpha Mega D1sks, both launching at the start of the Wave 3 sale. <br>
The only additional perk of the Alpha D1sks is that they will contribute more points toward both personal and community stretch goals. \
The Price of the Alpha D1sks is the same as the Wave 2 Alpha D1sks. <br>
The Alpha sale will take place for 24 hours or until sold out. After this period or when sold out - the sale continues automatically with the normal D1sk sale.

### Rationale
With the redesign of the Wave 3 sale event and the accompanying leaderboard structure, we are positioning Illuvium Beyond for a sustainable and exciting future. This proposal marks an essential step towards creating a standardised format for how the game will be played and how sales will be conducted. By laying this foundation now, we ensure that future developments can seamlessly integrate with the current system, maintaining both the fun and longevity of the ecosystem.
#### A Future-Focused Approach
The restructuring of the Wave 3 sale and leaderboard is not only a reflection of immediate needs but also part of a broader vision. As Illuvium Beyond evolves, we must establish frameworks that will be scalable and adaptable. These elements will shape the future of the game, ensuring it remains competitive and enjoyable for players of all levels. The focus on sustainability in both the sale structure and reward mechanisms is critical for the long-term health of the ecosystem, supporting growth while avoiding the pitfalls of short-term gains.
#### Emphasis on Fun and Longevity
The heart of Illuvium Beyond lies in its ability to offer an engaging, rewarding experience that participants can enjoy. By balancing the excitement of sales events with consistent and meaningful gameplay elements, we keep the focus on fun while ensuring the activities remain sustainable. As the game continues to develop, this emphasis on fun and long-term engagement will guide future decisions, helping to attract new players and retain existing ones.
