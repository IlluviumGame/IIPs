## Simple Summary
The Illuvinati Council is being presented with four tokens to vote upon for the 4th flash pool, following AXS.

## Abstract 
Once AXS flash pools has ended, create new ILV staking flash pool for the token voted in by the Council.

## Overview
The tokens being presented for Council vote were suggested by the community. Therefore, they represent tokens that the community feels would make flash pools in the best interests of the DAO.
 
## Rationale
It is vital that the tokens for flash pools are community-suggested, and that the Council votes for the next token, in order to preserve and demonstrate the tenet of a community-guided ILV protocol.

The six options currently nominated are:

* ALCX (Alchemix)
* AAVE (AAVE) 
* MVI (Meta Verse Index) 
* DPI (DeFi Pulse Index)  
* Pause flash pool launches
