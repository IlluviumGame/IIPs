## Thesis:
Gauntlet is better suited for a Web 2.5 approach, where ownership provides rewards but does not impact gameplay.
This would be in line with the industry standard of comparable games, having no p2w Elements.

## Abstract:
Labs should work towards creating a system that gives players of Gauntlet and future games rewards based on owning assets including but not limited to Illuvials, without having those assets impact the gameplay in a pay to win fashion.

## Rationale:
I believe Illuvium Labs spending Dev-time and resources on this is worth it and beneficial for the DAO because of the following:

### 1. Aligning with Industry Standards:
In the Web2 gaming space, the standard for successful games in the Battle Royale Autobattler genre is true Free-to-Play (F2P). 
These games typically monetize through cosmetics or similar non-impactful elements rather than pay-to-win (P2W) mechanics. 
Introducing ownership in Gauntlet should follow this principle, avoiding gameplay advantages tied to asset ownership. 
Historically, no P2W game in this genre has achieved sustainable success, making a F2P model the optimal choice for market competitiveness.

### 2. Expanding Player Base and Reducing Barriers:
P2W game modes often attract a small, top-heavy player base that prioritizes extracting rewards over genuine engagement. 
This leads to ranking manipulation and diminishes the appeal for the broader audience. 
Conversely, a true F2P system with accessible rewards ensures lower barriers for new players, significantly boosting customer acquisition and retention. 
It also positions Gauntlet to compete with lower-risk Play-to-Earn (P2E) games by reducing perceived entry costs.

### 3. Enhanced Matchmaking and Player Experience:
By removing P2W barriers and enabling rewards to coexist in the same matchmaking queues as F2P players, Gauntlet ensures faster matchmaking times and more balanced gameplay. 
This approach not only attracts new players from established games like Teamfight Tactics (TFT) but also creates a welcoming environment that encourages longer-term engagement.

### 4. Improving Public Perception and Marketability:
Games perceived as P2W often face significant backlash from players and the press, even if they generate substantial revenue. 
A system that avoids P2W pitfalls and instead emphasizes rewarding skill and participation enhances Gauntlet's reputation. 
This can lead to better community sentiment and long-term growth, particularly in the competitive gaming space.

### re Points 5. and 6.
A Ownership rewarding system could via Seasons or similar be used to incorporate other Assets outside of Illuvials in a for the DAO meaningful way.

### 5. Utility and Liquidity for Owned Assets:
Allowing owned assets such as Cosmetics, Promotional NFTs, Land, Illuvitars, and Weapons/Suits to influence reward eligibility (without impacting gameplay) provides utility for these assets. 
This increases their perceived value and liquidity, benefiting both players and the ecosystem. 
Additionally, it enables revenue generation through trading fees, creating a sustainable economic loop.

### 6. Collaboration Opportunities with Web3 Projects:
A reward system that accounts for ownership of external NFTs enables seamless collaborations with other Web3 projects. 
Partnering in this way can boost marketing efforts, attract new audiences, and foster a sense of interconnected value between ecosystems, further reinforcing Gauntlet's position as a forward-thinking Web3 game.

### 7. Strategic Use of Rewards as a Marketing Tool:
Rewards in Gauntlet serve as a powerful marketing tool to attract and retain players. 
Gating these rewards behind high or perceived as high pay barriers reduces their effectiveness and discourages adoption. 
Instead, integrating rewards with a low entry barrier maximizes their potential to bring in new players while retaining competitive integrity.

### 8. If Leviathan is overly incentivized compared to other game modes,
it might alienate the true whales who aren´t great at video games, but want to flex a rank or similar.
The rewards would make the “sweaty tryhard” gamers join that game and take the fun away from the whales.
