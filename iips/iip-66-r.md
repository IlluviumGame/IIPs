### Simple Summary
This proposal seeks to eliminate the bonus fuel system currently implemented under IIP-39 and introduce a minimum order size for fuel trades, with the objective of improving market transparency, reducing inefficiencies, and preventing rounding losses.


### Overview
This proposal recommends removing the bonus fuel system and replacing it with a transparent display of the current market price for fuel. In addition, it suggests setting a minimum order size in multiples of 20 to minimize inefficiencies and avoid rounding losses.


### Rationale
The current bonus fuel system was intended to give players a perceived discount on fuel purchases. However, it has caused market confusion and unpredictability. Players often find it difficult to determine the true cost of fuel, which has led to significant price volatility. By eliminating the bonus system and establishing a clear minimum order size, trading will become more straightforward, and rounding losses will be avoided. These changes will give players a clearer understanding of fuel pricing, enabling more informed decisions. Ultimately, the Illuvium fuel market will operate more predictably and transparently, benefiting both players and the broader ecosystem.
