## Simple Summary
Make it easier for DAO members to learn about candidates, express their preferences, and ensure all stakeholders have representation on the council. 
* Creating a more robust, standardized application process
* Creating a centralized location to store applicant content (e.g., interviews, the application)
* Expanding the council to nine seats
* Creating roles for key stakeholders on the Council
* Staggering Council Member elections 
* Allow voting for multiple candidates

## Abstract
Improvements to the Illuvium Council election process.

## Motivation
The current election process leads to a number of challenges.
* It's difficult to compare candidates
* Information about candidates is spread over a number of different places (discord, illuvium.io governance, youtube). Within each channel there a multiple subchannels (e.g., discord and youtube channels)
* There's the danger of people with the most name recognition getting the most votes based on notoriety alone.
* There's no gurantee all stakeholders (e.g., the community, content creators, guilds, core team, investors) will all a voice in council meetings.
* There's the potential for all council members to turn over at the same time, leading to a loss of institutional knowledge
* Only allowing one candidate leads to a council that doesn't necessarily represent the DAOs preference by hiding the preferences for non-first choice candidates. For example, if Person A was everyone's second choice, they would get no votes despite everyone in the DAO believing they deserved a seat on the council (given they only picked one person for a five seat council).
