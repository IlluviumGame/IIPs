## Simple Summary:
This proposal aims to ease onboarding, enhance early experience in the arena and facilitate the early learning phase. It also helps to keep the game fresh, incentivizes people to explore new illuvials/teams and therefore to spend. This proposal introduces a new rule structure for the Ascendant Arena, removing the rule that makes stage 1 illuvial count for higher stages, providing a variation of pre-built decks and introducing a free rotation of illuvials, ranger equipment, and augments.

## Abstract:
This proposal entails the introduction of the following Ascendant Arena rule changes:

1) Removal of the rule that allows a Stage 1 Illuvial to count as a higher-stage Illuvial.
2) Introduction of pre-built decks. 
3) Introduction of a free rotation of illuvials, ranger equipment, and augments.


## Overview:
Ascendant Arena Rule Structure

1) Stage 1 Illuvials will no longer be counted as higher-stage Illuvials.
This makes the most logical sense for an asset ownership based game and enhances the importance of strategic Illuvial development.  Having the stages as they are feels more natural, enables more variety and provides a more logical, fair spread between the value of the different Illuvials within a given line.

2) Players will have access to a certain variety of pre-built decks for free. 
This will remove any monetary or “web3” need to try and experience the ascendant arena. Having access to different types of decks will ensure they can experience different illuvials, synergies and mechanics during their first interactions with the game mode. Those pre-built decks will be useful as part of the tutorial and early learning phase in the Arena. 


3) A rotation of illuvials, ranger equipment, and augments will be introduced for free. 
This approach is prevalent in many games and facilitates players in experiencing new illuvials before purchasing. It also reduces the overall cost of decks at all levels and helps to keep the game fresh.


## Rationale:
This rule structure revision provides a fair ground for all players, ensuring that gameplay skills and strategic planning are more vital than the players' wallet sizes. It greatly facilitates the onboarding aspect, and fosters a healthy, competitive environment. 

Overall this proposal aims to better the experience of both new and current players by reducing the entry barrier and keeping the game fresh. It will help attract new players and retain them, ultimately benefiting Illuvium as a whole.

This proposal does not propose how the pre-built decks and free rotation would look as it’s impossible to know without the proper testing. The idea is to have those concepts be very limited in power so that the potential concerns are addressed while still fulfilling the goals.

Those changes are for the Ascendant mode only and not for Leviathan.
