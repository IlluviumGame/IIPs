## Simple Summary:
This proposal calls for the removal of the 3-month vesting period that recently got introduced.

## Reasoning:
The vesting period breaks the sense of immediate reward that keeps players engaged. It makes rewards feel less meaningful and discourages both new and existing players from grinding or competing. At this stage, Illuvium should prioritize player retention and acquisition over minimal token pressure concerns.
The amount of ILV distributed through gameplay is relatively small compared to the circulating supply and has little market impact, but it has a major effect on player motivation. Instant rewards make the ecosystem more appealing for new players and more rewarding for those already invested in the game.

## Goal:
Improve player retention and make Illuviumâ€™s rewards more attractive to new players by removing the vesting period and restoring immediate reward claims.
