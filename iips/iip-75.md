## Simple Summary:
This proposal introduces the Illuvial Collection system, a new leaderboard that ranks players based on the strength and completeness of their Illuvial team. The system rewards collection progression by providing indirect in-game incentives, such as multipliers to battle pass rewards and raffle tickets.
The goal is to strengthen the value of Illuvials as the core assets of the Illuvium ecosystem, boost player engagement,reward ownership and long-term participation. It also serves as a first step toward valuing ownership across the ecosystem and establishing the foundation for the ecosystem economy loop that will ultimately drive DAO revenue.

## Abstract:
Illuvials are the foundation of the Illuvium ecosystem. Their demand drives players to engage with Overworld/ADR, which in turn gives value to landholders. As the assets in the ecosystem finally come to life and the game’s economic loop begins, it will restore player and investor confidence, ultimately benefiting Illuvium Beyond and supporting the token’s value. With the pro scene and marketing campaign now ramping up, it’s the ideal time to start that ecosystem loop.
The Illuvial Collection would function similarly to the Illuvitar leaderboards which attributes a total power based on the traits that matter. Illuvirank(.)com is a great example of how the Illuvial Collection leaderboard would look like. Players climb the leaderboard automatically based on the strength and diversity of their owned Illuvials. The ranking would take into account Tier, Stage, Level, TPI, and Finishes (Holo, Dark Holo), using only the best version of each Illuvial in a player’s team
Players who perform well in the Collection leaderboard would unlock indirect, non-monetary benefits such as, multipliers applied to their battle pass and raffle tickets entries. These multipliers scale progressively based on leaderboard rank, creating an ongoing incentive to improve collections.

## Specification:
**1. Illuvial Collection Leaderboard**
Automatically ranks players based on owned Illuvials.
Scoring criteria include: Tier, Stage, Level, TPI, and Finish (Holo, Dark Holo).
Only the strongest version of each Illuvial counts (e.g., one Atlas total per player).
Leaderboard updates dynamically as collections change.
**2. Reward Multipliers**
Multipliers apply to battle pass rewards and raffle ticket generation.
Higher leaderboard placement yields stronger multipliers.
Very inclusive leaderboard where the first thresholds are easily achievable by only acquiring a couple illuvials.
Granular grouping to incentivize as much as possible people to always keep pushing.

 501–600: 1.15×
 601–700: 1.12×
 701–800: 1.09×
 801–900: 1.06×

(Exact brackets and values to be determined by Illuvium Labs.)
**3. Integration with Battle Pass**
Future battle passes will include more loot box–style rewards (fuel boxes, XP boxes, Beyond disks, ADR runs, etc.) to better integrate with the multiplier system.
Multipliers affect loot box tier or reward quantity.
**4. System Implementation**
Leaderboard data calculated automatically via player account inventories.
Scoring formulas to be developed and balanced by Illuvium Labs.
Leaderboard display integrated on the website, could be tied with the “My Collection” section.

## Rationale:
**First step to start the ecosystem’s Loop**
The Illuvial Collection directly links ownership to progression and indirectly start to give utility to the the Illuvials
**Sustainable Incentives without DAO Cost**
Multipliers affect in-game rewards that don’t carry direct financial impact to the DAO, creating a cost-efficient incentive structure.
**Fair and Inclusive Design**
Low entry barriers allow new players to participate and earn small multipliers with only a few Illuvials, while dedicated collectors compete for top ranks and higher bonuses.
