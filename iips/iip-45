## Simple Summary:
Illuvium Zero Land was sold with the intention of returning 5% of the total revenue generated from in-game purchases to its holders. This proposal aims to guarantee that landowners receive those returns from all existing and future games within the Illuvium ecosystem.

## Abstract:
Illuvium Zero generates FUEL, landowners receive a 5% share of the revenue when it is sold on the market. However, there may be in-game purchases made without using FUEL. This proposal ensures that 5% of all in-game purchases, regardless of whether FUEL is used or not, are returned to landowners for all current and future Illuvium games, including, but not limited to, D1SK sales within Illuvium Beyond.

## Overview:
Whenever possible, Illuvium should use FUEL as a currency for in-game purchases. When in-game purchases occur without using FUEL, the revenue should be distributed to landowners after reaching a certain threshold. Threshold and distribution method will be decided on by  Illuvium Labs
Before launching a new project within the Illuvium ecosystem, it should be made clear whether or not it constitutes a “game.” All in-game purchases within an Illuvium game will be subject to this revenue share model.

## Rational:
Clearly defining that land owners will receive a share of 5% of all in-game revenue for current and future games will instill greater confidence in land as a long-term investment.
