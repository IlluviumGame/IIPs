## Summary:
This proposal introduces a progression system that ties player rewards to a collection of illuvials and playing all current and future games. It incentivizes passive collecting (endless progression) and playing all of our games (season based, to keep things fresh and engaging). The Tree starts grey and hollow, and it obtains its color, fruits and glow as players acquire new illuvials, improve their collection and progress the 3 different tiers. This system will act as the foundation to build use cases for collecting assets and can easily connect to other parts of the ecosystem through additional branches/mini trees. 
It merges collecting, competing, and progression into one long-term system that rewards both engagement and ownership.

## Abstract:
Illuvials are the foundation of the Illuvium ecosystem. Their demand drives players to engage with Overworld/ADR, which in turn gives value to landholders. As the assets in the ecosystem finally come to life and the game’s economic loop begins, it will restore player and investor confidence, ultimately benefiting Illuvium's eco and supporting the token’s value. With the pro scene, marketing campaign and the MMO approaching, it’s the ideal time to start that ecosystem loop to tie everything together. 
The Collection Tree has multiple levels and sections designed to let every type of player have goals, progress and things to look/work towards. It offers a low barrier of entry for newcomers while maintaining higher tiers that keep it engaging for top collectors. 
On top of the basic collecting, the tree can have branches for different games or to be tied to other reward systems in our ecosystem. 
This proposal leaves the exact reward formula to Labs but suggests a few key principles: it should be inclusive to help onboard new players, meaningful enough to motivate progression toward the top, and tied to gameplay to encourage ongoing engagement and collection growth.

## Specification:
**Level 1 / Collecting all illuvials**
Collecting each line of illuvials and completing tiers would unlock some rewards up to completing the whole collection of 205 illuvials, just basic ownership.
**Level 2 / TPI & Levels**
Further points would be attributed to the TPI and level of each illuvials (no duplicate).
Players would unlock rewards as they get more points and their collection in this tier improves.
**Level 3 / Finishes**
Collecting each line of illuvials in holo/dark holo finish versions. This tier is mostly tailored for collectors and to extend their progression further.
**Best Collection Leaderboard**
Optional, depending on how we want to approach things. It can be either done similar to howilluvirank(.)com did it, or we can use our tree point system for it perfectly.
We get points for progressing each tier. We get points per illuvial for - ownership (first and lowest points acquired), tpi, levels and holo/dh touch. A single illuvial can cover all 3 tier criteria, if they are the highest tpi/lvl and also with a dh/holo touch at the same time.
**Games/Other System’s Branches**
We can have our main collection tree in the middle, which is based on collecting illuvials of all types as per the tier criteria. We can then have mini trees around it, for each game that we release and is tied to using illuvials. The trees for each game will have gameplay goals/missions/quests that people compete for in a season, and for the final rewards and progression of those mini trees, we get a multiplier by the main collections tree.

## Rationale:
**Kickstarting the Ecosystem Loop**
This system connects ownership directly to progression, gameplay and tying any game rewards to our collection, giving Illuvials real utility across the ecosystem. With its multiple levels, the Collection Tree supports every type of player. It represents the first step toward making ownership a core part of Illuvium’s value.
**Sustainable Incentives**
Gameplay-based rewards, such as NFTs, XP Crates, ADR, or cosmetic disks, are highly effective motivators. This system can also integrate with ongoing in-game reward structures, creating a natural link between collection progress and gameplay achievements. 
**Inclusive Yet Competitive**
This proposal targets everyone - from f2p players looking to slowly improve their collection, to whales, collectors, casual and competitive players. There would be things to do for everyone. And to progress them further each player must progress their tree as further as possible, which is directly tied to revenue for the DAO. That way rewards can be earned through playing our games and collecting, still tied to real revenue for the DAO, instead of simply selling them in a shop for example. The sky is the limit - the further we expand on it and build it up the better results it's going to yield.
