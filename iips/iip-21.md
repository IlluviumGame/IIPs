## Simple Summary

Changes to Governance processes while waiting for Governance V2:

1. Modify Epoch length to 6 months.
2. Council Payments paid in Stablecoin (USDT), not ILV anymore.
3. An Official 'Governance Forum' on Illuvium website for better IIP Organization.

## Abstract

Governance improvements help us keep up with the constantly evolving landscape of Illuvium. This IIP suggests three critical enhancements before the new Epoch begins.

The current community sentiment is that Epoch's length is not long enough for council members to immerse themselves in council operations fully. For this reason, we suggest extending Epochs by an additional three months.

Some community members have pointed out that the current payment type of ILV isn't ideal due to the potential swings in price. We propose changing council payments from ILV to USDT.

The last enhancement is building a dedicated forum for governance discussions (Until V2 Governance is live).

## Rationale

The number of IIPs expected as we move into game launch is scheduled to ramp up considerably. Due to election periods, it would be beneficial to have council members retain a seat longer than campaigning every three months. Giving council members more time allows them to materialize ideas into real IIPs and adequately engage with the team and community.

Previously IIP-12 made changes to the council stipend, which was sufficient at the time; due to the current price of ILV, it no longer makes sense to pay in ILV. Paying in stable coins means we can control the amount each month.

The community has asked for an improved governance forum since our first Epoch. We agree that Governance will benefit from a dedicated platform on the main website for IIPs and ICCPs.
