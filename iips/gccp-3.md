## Summary
This proposal seeks to temporarily **pause council payments** and **redirect those funds to support active X (Twitter), YouTube, and Twitch streamers** who are actively promoting and engaging with Illuvium. Given the shifting landscape of Web3 and crypto gaming, **council responsibilities have changed**, and community sentiment suggests that council payments currently yield minimal tangible benefits. This IIP proposes leveraging these funds to **empower content creators who bring real-time engagement, education, and visibility** to Illuvium.

## Motivation
- **Inefficient Use of Treasury Funds**
  - Council payments were originally designed for governance duties, but the evolving landscape means council members may not need compensation at prior levels.
   - Many passionate community members are willing to contribute without pay out of dedication to Illuvium.
- **Limited Perceived Community Representation**
   - A growing sentiment suggests that the **community feels underrepresented by the current council**, and reallocating funds to content creators could provide more direct value.
- **Increasing Content, Engagement & Reach**
   - Web3 gaming thrives on exposure. Streaming and social media engagement drive **organic adoption**.
   - Many **Illuvium streamers struggle with sustaining content** due to lack of resources.
   - Supporting streamers would help **increase frequency, quality, and reach of Illuvium content**, directly benefiting marketing and community growth.


## Proposal Details
1. **Temporarily pause council compensation** for a set period (**12 months**), allowing for a reassessment afterward.
2. **Redirect those ILV funds to a structured grant program** for approved X, YouTube, and Twitch streamers actively producing Illuvium content.
3. **Establish clear qualification criteria** for content creators (e.g., consistent streaming schedule, engagement metrics, educational content).
4. **Implement a transparent application and selection process** to ensure fair allocation of funds.
5. **Assess impact after the trial period** to determine if funds should continue to support content creators or revert to the council.

## Potential Benefits

✅ Increased visibility for Illuvium across streaming platforms

✅ Stronger community engagement and education

✅ More active gameplay showcasing Illuvium’s ecosystem

✅ Direct, measurable return on investment through analytics & reach

✅ Treasury funds utilized for tangible, high-impact marketing efforts


## Risks & Considerations
- **Governance Stability**
   - Suspending council payments may reduce incentives for participation. However, the **presence of willing unpaid contributors** minimises this risk.
- **Fair Distribution of Funds**
   - A **structured grant program with clear selection criteria** will be needed to ensure fairness.
- **Potential Backlash from Council Members**
   - Some council members may oppose losing compensation, but the **reallocation is temporary and meant to maximise current impact.**

## Voting Options
✅ Yes - Temporarily pause council payments and redirect ILV to community streamers.

❌ No - Keep council payments as is.
