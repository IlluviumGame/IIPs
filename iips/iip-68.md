## Abstract:
This proposal recommends transferring the remaining ILV from the paused rewards program into the Illuvium DAO Treasury. 
This will increase Treasury holdings, boost investor confidence, and provide more flexibility for capital raises. 
Future rewards will come from the Treasury, ensuring a more strategic allocation of ILV while supporting long-term financial sustainability.

## Simple Summary
We propose transferring the ILV remaining in the rewards pool to the Treasury. This strengthens the Treasury, allowing for greater flexibility in funding key initiatives like capital raises. 
Future rewards will be financed by the Treasury, ensuring a more deliberate, strategic approach, as the Treasury is governed by the council rather than being categorised as "marketing."

## Overview
The rewards program was paused to reassess its impact, leaving a significant amount of ILV in the rewards pool. 
This proposal suggests moving those funds into the Treasury to position the DAO better financially and enable more strategic use of ILV.

With this move, the Treasury can support future capital raises and essential studio costs while continuing to fund tournaments and leaderboards. 
Instead of being categorised as "marketing," the Treasury will now control rewards governed by the council. This makes ILV spending more focused and aligned with the DAOâ€™s broader goals.

## Rationale:
By transferring the remaining ILV to the Treasury, the DAO strengthens its financial reserves and increases its share of revenue distributions. 
This provides flexibility for covering operational costs and capital raises while funding player incentives like tournaments and leaderboards.

With rewards now controlled by the Treasury, governed by the council, every ILV spent will be part of a strategic plan to maximise value for the ecosystem, ensuring long-term success.
